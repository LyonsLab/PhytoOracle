# PhytoOracle

PhytoOracle is a scalable, distributed workflow manager for analyzing highthroughput phenotyping data.  
It is designed to process data from the [UA Gantry](https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place), but can be adapted to work on data coming from other platforms.  
PhytoOracle uses a master-worker framework for distributed computing (HPC, Cloud, etc.) and can run jobs on nearly all unix-like environments.
