*********************************************
Running the FlirIr Pipeline for Infrared Data
*********************************************

Outline
=======

Welcome to PhytoOracle's FlirIr pipeline! This pipeline uses the data transformers from the [AgPipeline group](https://github.com/AgPipeline/) to extract thermal data from image files. 

Transformers Used
=================

FlirIr currently uses 3 different transformers for data conversion:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transformer
     - Process
   * - `cleanmetadata <https://github.com/AgPipeline/moving-transformer-cleanmetadata>`_
     - Cleans gantry generated metadata
   * - `flir2tif <https://github.com/AgPipeline/moving-transformer-flir2tif>`_
     - Converts bin compressed files to tif 
   * - `meantemp <https://github.com/AgPipeline/moving-transformer-meantemp>`_ 
     - Extracts temperature from detected biomass

Data Overview
=============

PhytoOracle's FlirIr requires a metadata file (`<metadata>.json`) for every compressed image file (`<image>.bin`). These should already be in the same folder when obtaining data from the `CyVerse DataStore <https://cyverse.org/data-store>`_.

Setup Guide
===========

+ Go `here <https://phytooracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_HPC_install.html>`_ to launch on an HPC system (tested on the University of Arizona's HPC system).

+ Go `here <https://phytooracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_CloudHPC_install.html>`_ instead if using a cloud system with HPC support (tested on CyVerse Atmosphere, soon to be tested on NSF's JetStream).

Running on the HPC's Interactive Node
=====================================

At this point your worker nodes should already be running and you should be in your FlirIr directory within your interactive node. Download the data that you need using:

.. code::

   iget -rKVP /iplant/home/shared/terraref/ua-mac/raw_tars/season_10_yr_2020/flirIrCamera/<day>.tar


Replace :code:`<day>` with any day you want to process. Un-tar and move the folder to the FlirIr directory.

.. code::

   tar -xvf <day>.tar
   mv ./flirIrCamera/<day> ./

Then edit your :code:`entrypoint.sh` on line 4 to reflect the :code:`<day>` folder you want to process.

Once everything is edited, run the pipeline with :code:`./entrypoint.sh`.

Running on the Cloud with HPC support
=====================================

Although very similar to the steps above,  to run PhytoOracle on the Cloud with HPC support, there are a few extra steps  you have to carry out for data staging before starting the pipeline with :code:`./entrypoint.sh`.

Using your favouring editing tool do

.. code::

   /etc/nginx/sites-available/phyto_oracle.conf


paste the next snipped and save (changing the highlighted :code:`<fields>`)

.. code::

   server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # SSL configuration
        #
        # listen 443 ssl default_server;
        # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
        #
        # Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
        #
        # Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
        #
        # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
        # Don't use them in a production server!
        #
        # include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

        root <PATH/TO/YOUR/PHYTOORACLE/PIPELINE>;

        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                auth_basic "PhytoOracle Data";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/apache2/.htpasswd;
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                autoindex on;
        }
    }


then from within your Transformer directory do :code:`./nginx_reload.sh`. Input your password if asked.

Open and edit :code:`process_one_set.sh` : 

- delete the :code:`#` on lines 37 and 38
- remove :code:`${HPC_PATH}` on lines 24, 25, 28
