**PhytoOracle: A scalable, modular data pipeline**
==================================================
PhytoOracle is a scalable, modular data pipeline for phenomics research. It uses CCTools' Makeflow and WorkQueue distributed task management frameworks. As a result, PhytoOracle significantly reduces data processing times. The pipeline also enables researchers to swap between supported extractors or to easily integrate new extractors. PhytoOracle is, therefore, able to handle the increasing rate of data collection while making it accessible to a wide range of users.
