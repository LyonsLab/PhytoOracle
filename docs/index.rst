PhytoOracle is a scalable, distributed workflow manager for analyzing highthroughput phenotyping data.  
It is designed to process data from the `UA Gantry <https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place,>`_, but can be adapted to work on data coming from other platforms.  
PhytoOracle uses a master-worker framework for distributed computing (HPC, Cloud, etc.) and can run jobs on nearly all unix-like environments.

     - Custom 3D Fraunhofer
     - Laser scanning images.  Generates a point cloud for measuring physical structure of plants.
   * - Hyperspectral (VNIR/SWIR)
     - Custom Headwall Photonics
     - Hyperspectral images.  Collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum for a wide variety of phenotypes (e.g., vegetation indices)

Pipeline Structure
==================

All of the pipelines follow the same structure that allows for accessiblility, scalability, and modularity. The steps are:

1. Setting up the Master interactive node and Worker nodes on the HPC
2. Cloning the pipeline of choice
3. Staging the data
4. Editing the scripts
5. Launching the pipeline
