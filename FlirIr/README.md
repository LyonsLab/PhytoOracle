# PhytoOracle's FlirIr Pipeline

#### Outline

Welcome to PhytoOracle's FlirIr pipeline! This pipeline uses the data transformers from the AgPipeline group to extract thermal data from image files. PhytoOracle's FlirIr was primarely built to process data originating from University of Arizona's gantry system, the world's largest robotic field scanner. The FlirIr pipeline is avaiable for either HPC (High Performance Computing) systems or cloud based systems.
